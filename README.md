## About Investigate Toolkit 
The Investigate Toolkit provides additional functionality to Nuix Investigate, including the ability to:  
* Import users from Active Directory into Investigate  
* Add users to Investigate groups based on Active Directory groups  
* Add cases to Investigate groups based on the directory location  
* Run CSV and Excel audit reports  
* Create and edit search filters  

Once configured, the toolkit can be scheduled to perform these actions silently and provide an audit log of the actions taken.
