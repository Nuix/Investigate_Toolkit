## About Investigate Toolkit 
The Investigate Toolkit provides additional functionality to Nuix Investigate, including the ability to:  
* Import users from Active Directory into Investigate  
* Add users to Investigate groups based on Active Directory groups  
* Add cases to Investigate groups based on the directory location  
* Create Investigate groups from the command line
* Run CSV and Excel audit reports  

Once configured, the toolkit can be scheduled to perform these actions silently and provide an audit log of the actions taken.  

## Installation
Installation is not required in order to use the Investigate Toolkit. The toolkit is comprised of the following files, which should be copied into a single directory onj any machine which can access both AD and Investigate:
